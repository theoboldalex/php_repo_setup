# Basic PHP repo bootstrap

This repo is a bootstrap that sets up a simple PHP environment with PHPUnit and PHPCS with Doctrine.

To use this repo, run the test script and ensure you have Docker running.

```bash
./test.sh
```

You can also get a simple coverage report out of the test script by running

```bash
./test.sh --coverage-text
```
